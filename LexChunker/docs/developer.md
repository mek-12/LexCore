# Unstructured.io (Python)

Specifically built for parsing messy HTML, PDF, Word documents, etc.

Extracts semantic units: titles, paragraphs, bullets, tables, etc.

Output format is JSON — perfect to later convert into chunks.

Ideal when your legal documents are in HTML/PDF formats.

# Python da Hangfire a alternatif olarak Celery kullanılabilir.
